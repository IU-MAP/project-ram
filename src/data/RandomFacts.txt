And God I know I`m one
And it`s been the ruin of many a poor boy
And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell
And the only time he`s satisfied
And you could have it all
Any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows doesn`t really matter to me, to me
Ask me, baby, why I`m sad
Because I`m easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!
Be free of you, but I`ll still be sad
Beneath the stains of time
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
But I`m just a poor boy, nobody loves me
But I remember everything
But now I`ve gone and thrown it all away
But when Pierre found work, the little money comin` worked out well
But when the sun went down, the rapid tempo of the music fell
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
"C`est la vie", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell
Come kill me, honey, see how I cry
Don`t tell me different, know it`s a lie
Down in New Orleans
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Everyone I know
Full of broken thoughts
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
Goes away in the end
Goodbye, everybody, I`ve got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
He`s just a poor boy from a poor family
I am still right here
I cannot repair
I don`t wanna die
If I`m not back again this time tomorrow
I focus on the pain
If you keep on tellin` me those lies
I hurt myself today
I`ll be happy, not so blue
I`ll be unhappy if I let you go
I`m goin` back to New Orleans
I`m just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
In spite of your cheatin`, still love you so
In the House of the Rising Sun
Is a suitcase and trunk
I see a little silhouetto of a man
I sometimes wish I`d never been born at all
Is this just fantasy?
Is this the real life?
Is when he`s all drunk
It was a teenage wedding, and the old folks wished them well
It was there that Pierre was married to the lovely mademoiselle
I wear this crown of thorns
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Ah
(Let me go) Will not let you go
Liar, liar, pants on fire
Listen here, girl, can`t you see I love you
Make a little effort, try to be true
Mama, just killed a man
Mama, life had just begun
Mama, ooh (Anyway the wind blows)
Mama, ooh, didn`t mean to make you cry
My empire of dirt
My father was a gamblin` man
My mother was a tailor
My sweetest friend
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters to me
Not to do what I have done
Now the only thing a gambler needs
Oh, baby, can`t do this to me, baby!
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Oh mother tell your children
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he`s dead
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Sends shivers down my spine, body`s aching all the time
Seven hundred little records, all rock, rhythm and jazz
She sewed my new blue jeans
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Spend your lives in sin and misery
Still goin` out with other guys
Take my advice, won`t be long
The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale
The feelings disappear
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
The only thing that`s real
The other foot on the train
There is a house in New Orleans
There`ll come a day I`ll be gone
They bought a souped-up jitney, `twas a cherry red `53
They call the Rising Sun
They drove it down to Orleans to celebrate the anniversary
They furnished off an apartment with a two room Roebuck sale
They had a hi-fi phono, boy, did they let it blast
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
Too late, my time has come
To see if I still feel
To wear that ball and chain
Try to kill it all away
Upon my liars chair
Well, I got one foot on the platform
Well, there is a house in New Orleans
What have I become
When that day comes, won`t be mad
Why must you hurt me, do what you do
You are someone else
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
Your nose is longer than a telephone wire
You`ve been out all night, know you`ve been bad
